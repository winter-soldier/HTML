        It’s important to stay active when you’re stuck inside.Staying at home
        for prolonged periods of time can pose a significant challenge for
        remaining physically active. Sedentary behaviour and low levels of
        physical activity can have negative effects on the health, well-being
        and quality of life of individuals. Self-quarantine can also cause
        additional stress and challenge the mental health. Physical activity and
        relaxation techniques can be valuable tools to help you remain calm and
        continue to protect your health during this time.

        It is recommended that 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes
        of vigorous-intensity physical activity per week, or a combination of
        both. These recommendations can still be achieved even at home, with no
        special equipment and with limited space. The following are some tips on
        how to stay active and reduce sedentary behaviour while at home in
        self-quarantine:

        Dancing, playing with children, and performing domestic chores such as
        cleaning and gardening are other means to stay active at home.

        be cautious and aware of your own limitations.

        <strong> Walk.</strong> Even in small spaces, walking around or walking
        on the spot, can help you remain active. If you have a call, stand or
        walk around your home while you speak, instead of sitting down. If you
        decide to go outside to walk or exercise, be sure to maintain at least a
        1-meter distance from other people.

        <strong> Stand up.</strong> Reduce your sedentary time by standing up
        whenever possible. Ideally, aim to interrupt sitting and reclining time
        every 30 minutes. Consider setting up a standing desk by using a high
        table or stacking a pile of books or other materials, to continue
        working while standing. During sedentary leisure time prioritize
        cognitively stimulating activities, such as reading, board games, and
        puzzles.

        and strictly avoid these in young people, and pregnant and breastfeeding
        women, or for other health reasons. Ensure plenty of fruits and
        vegetables, and limit the intake of salt, sugar and fat. Prefer whole
        grains rather than refined foods.

        Calisthenics
      </h2>

      <p class="flow-text">
        Calisthenics is a great way to start exercising from home. Calisthenics
        is a type of exercise consisting of a variety of simple movements
        usually performed without weights or other equipment that are intended
        to increase body strength and flexibility using the weight of one's own
        body for resistance. Calisthenics is composed of free-arm (similar to
        gymnastics), aesthetics (a graceful form of dance), rhythmic (similar to
        ballet), folk dance, singing, marching, club-swinging and metal rod
        exercises.
